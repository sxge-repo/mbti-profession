# The Perfect Match: Unraveling the MBTI-Profession Compatibility Puzzle

## Welcome Curious Minds ðŸ‘‹

Have you ever wondered which professions attract extraverts or introverts, thinkers or feelers? The Perfect Match project sets out to uncover the fascinating correlation between MBTI personality types and professions. By examining a comprehensive dataset of renowned individuals, we aim to shed light on the prevalence of certain MBTI attributes within specific fields.

## Context

The Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI) has grown increasingly popular, not only in the entertainment industry but also in various professional fields. In some countries, such as South Korea, MBTI results are even considered in job applications. This widespread interest highlights the need for a comprehensive analysis of MBTI-profession compatibility.

## Problem

Despite the growing interest in MBTI, there was no readily available dataset covering the correlation between MBTI personality types and professions. This lack of data made it challenging to perform any significant analysis or draw meaningful conclusions on the topic.

## Solution

To address this problem, we:
1. **Web-Scraped Data:** Collected data of over 42,000 individuals from the Personality Database API using Python.
2. **Data Cleaning and Transformation:** Cleaned and transformed the raw data using R, preparing it for analysis.
3. **Exploratory Analysis:** Conducted exploratory data analysis to uncover patterns and insights.
4. **Data Visualization:** Created interactive visualizations with Tableau to present the findings in an engaging and accessible way.
